# A Brief History of DevOps

DevOps is a cultural and technical movement that emerged from the need to bridge the gap between **development** and **operations** teams.  Traditional software development often suffered from long release cycles and siloed responsibilities.  DevOps promotes collaboration, automation and continuous delivery to improve software quality and reduce time to market.

In this file, you'll add your own notes on key milestones in DevOps history as you progress through the course.  For example:

- The introduction of Agile methodologies in the early 2000s
- The rise of continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)
- The adoption of containerisation and orchestration tools

Feel free to edit this document during the labs.  Use `git add` and `git commit` to track your changes and reflect on how the commit history evolves.
