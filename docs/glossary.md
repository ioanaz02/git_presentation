# Glossary

This glossary contains key terms from the DevOps and Git domains.  As you encounter new concepts during the course, expand this list with your own definitions and examples.  Some starter entries are provided below:

- **Repository:** A storage location for your code and its history, managed by a version control system like Git.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of changes recorded in the repository's history.  Each commit has a unique ID and message.
- **Branch:** A movable pointer to a specific commit, allowing parallel streams of work.

Add at least two more terms by the end of the first lab.  Remember to `git add` and `git commit` your changes along the way.
